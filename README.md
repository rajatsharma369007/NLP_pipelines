# Introduction
This repository will help you create a Natural Language Processing Pipeline from scratch with the help of below example notebooks. NLP pipelines help automate a preprocessing workflow required to take sentiments or analysis out of a given dataset.

# Notebooks
* [Cleaning](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/NLP_pipelines/blob/master/cleaning_practice.ipynb)
* [Normalization](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/NLP_pipelines/blob/master/normalization_practice.ipynb)
* [Tokenization](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/NLP_pipelines/blob/master/tokenization_practice.ipynb)
* [Stop Words](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/NLP_pipelines/blob/master/stop_words_practice.ipynb)
* [POS Tagging](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/NLP_pipelines/blob/master/pos_ner_practice.ipynb)
* [Stemming and Lemmatization](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/NLP_pipelines/blob/master/stem_lemmatize_practice.ipynb)
* [Bag of Words and TF-IDF](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/NLP_pipelines/blob/master/bow_tfidf_practice.ipynb)


# Issues
Please open issues on github to report bugs or error or any optimisation you want to share.

# Contribution
If you are interested in improving the code, please open the issue first to describe the task you are planning to do. For small fixes (a few lines of change) feel free to open pull requests directly.
